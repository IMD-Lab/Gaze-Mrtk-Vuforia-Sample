# Gaze-Mrtk-Vuforia-Sample
Sample for testing eye gaze function in HoloLens2 with other stuff (Unity)

## Note
Because vuforia package is too large for git, get [Vuforia-10.7.2](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/k5pv9btk3b5amho/AACw_EzHn0N1oDrP05bOhmvea?dl=0) and place in /Packages directory before opening in Unity to install the package smoothly.

###### Reminder: In Unity Build Settings, switch platform to UWP. Finally, open EyeAndImageTrackingScene.
